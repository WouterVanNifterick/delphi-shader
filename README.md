# delphi-shader
Hundreds of graphical effects, and a library that provides GLSL functionality in pure Delphi code

This project produces an executable with more than a hundred real-time graphical effects. Some recorded examples are below.

All that is a 100% pascal implementation, without the use of exernal libraries or hardware acceleration.

The project consists of 4 parts:
1. A unit that implements most of the GLSL constructs.
 
2. 2. 2. An application to run effects in.
 
3. 3. More than a hundred graphical effects; most of them converted from http://www.shadertoy.com and http://glsl.heroku.com
 
4. A program that converts GLSL code to Delphi code.
